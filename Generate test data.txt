Produce C# (.NET 6) code using the Bogus library to generate two linked datasets with synthetic data, 100+ entries each.
Store generated test data in separate files in CSV format.
The generated test data represents an arbitrary dataset of movies, series, and credits related to them.
The generated test data should consist of two relations with the next structure and relationships:

"Titles" dataset:
titles.id numeric title identifier
titles.title textual movie (series) name
titles.description textual title description
titles.release_year should have a Common Era year format
titles.age_certification should be one of these: G, PG, PG-13, R, NC-17, U, U/A, A, S, AL, 6, 9, 12, 12A, 15, 18, 18R, R18, R21, M, MA15+, R16, R18+, X18, T, E, E10+, EC, C, CA, GP, M/PG, TV-Y, TV-Y7, TV-G, TV-PG, TV-14, TV-MA
titles.runtime should be a common title duration in minutes
titles.genres should contain a list of strings representing various movie (series) genres
titles.production_country should represent a country in ISO 3166-1 Alpha-3 code
titles.seasons should represent the number of seasons for series or be empty for movies

"Credits" dataset:
credits.id numeric credits identifier
credits.title_id corresponding Title id
credits.real_name full credits member name
credits.character_name corresponding movie (series) character name
credits.role should represent corresponding role and be one of these: Director, Producer, Screenwriter, Actor, Actress, Cinematographer, Film Editor, Production Designer, Costume Designer, Music Composer

The generated test data should cover a wide range of scenarios, including positive, negative, and edge cases, to ensure comprehensive testing of the application's functionality.
The test data should accurately represent the expected input and output data types, formats, and values, ensuring that it is suitable for validating the application's functionality.
The test data should be diverse and include different combinations of inputs, ensuring that the application is tested against a variety of scenarios.

Here is an example of how you can use the Bogus library to generate synthetic data based on the specifications given. This code is written in C# and assumes you have already installed the Bogus NuGet package and the CsvHelper NuGet package.

First, define classes for your data structures:

csharp
Copy code
public class Title
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string TitleName { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public int ReleaseYear { get; set; }
    public string AgeCertification { get; set; }
    public int Runtime { get; set; }
    public string Genres { get; set; }
    public string ProductionCountry { get; set; }
    public int? Seasons { get; set; }
}

public class Credit
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int TitleId { get; set; }
    public string RealName { get; set; }
    public string CharacterName { get; set; }
    public string Role { get; set; }
}
Next, generate the test data:

csharp
Copy code
using Bogus;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;
using System.Linq;
using CsvHelper;
using System.Globalization;
using System;

public class TestDataGenerator
{
    private static readonly string[] AgeCertifications = { "G", "PG", "PG-13", "R", "NC-17", "U", "U/A", "A", "S", "AL", "6", "9", "12", "12A", "15", "18", "18R", "R18", "R21", "M", "MA15+", "R16", "R18+", "X18", "T", "E", "E10+", "EC", "C", "CA", "GP", "M/PG", "TV-Y", "TV-Y7", "TV-G", "TV-PG", "TV-14", "TV-MA" };
    private static readonly string[] Roles = { "Director", "Producer", "Screenwriter", "Actor", "Actress", "Cinematographer", "Film Editor", "Production Designer", "Costume Designer", "Music Composer" };

    public void GenerateTestData()
    {
        var random = new Random();
        var titleFaker = new Faker<Title>()
            .RuleFor(t => t.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex)
            .RuleFor(t => t.TitleName, f => f.Lorem.Word())
            .RuleFor(t => t.Description, f => f.Lorem.Sentence())
            .RuleFor(t => t.ReleaseYear, f => f.Date.Between(new DateTime(1880, 1, 1), DateTime.Now).Year)
            .RuleFor(t => t.AgeCertification, f => f.PickRandom(AgeCertifications))
            .RuleFor(t => t.Runtime, f => f.Random.Int(60, 240))
            .RuleFor(t => t.Genres, f => string.Join(", ", f.Lorem.Words(random.Next(1, 5))))
            .RuleFor(t => t.ProductionCountry, f => f.Address.CountryCode())
            .RuleFor(t => t.Seasons, f => f.Random.Bool(0.7f) ? (int?)null : f.Random.Int(1, 10));

        var creditFaker = new Faker<Credit>()
            .RuleFor(c => c.Id, f => f.UniqueIndex)
            .RuleFor(c => c.TitleId, f => f.Random.Int(0, 100))
            .RuleFor(c => c.RealName, f => f.Name.FullName())
            .RuleFor(c => c.CharacterName, f => f.Name.FullName())
            .RuleFor(c => c.Role, f => f.PickRandom(Roles));

        var titles = titleFaker.Generate(100);
        var credits = creditFaker.Generate(100);

        WriteToCsv(titles, "Titles.csv");
        WriteToCsv(credits, "Credits.csv");
    }

    private void WriteToCsv<T>(IEnumerable<T> records, string path)
    {
        using var writer = new StreamWriter(path);
        using var csv = new CsvWriter(writer, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
        csv.WriteRecords(records);
    }
}
In this example, we use the Faker class from the Bogus library to generate synthetic data for the Title and Credit classes. We then generate 100 instances of each class and write them to CSV files using CsvHelper.

Please make sure you adapt the generated data to your needs as this is a simple and straightforward example. There might be a need for more complex generation of data to match the domain constraints of your problem.

To run the data generation process, simply instantiate the TestDataGenerator class and call the GenerateTestData method:

csharp
Copy code
var testDataGenerator = new TestDataGenerator();
testDataGenerator.GenerateTestData();

Now write the Program.cs file that uses the TestDataGenerator to generate this data.
ChatGPT
Here is a simple Program.cs that creates a new TestDataGenerator object and calls its GenerateTestData method to generate the test data:

csharp
Copy code
using System;

namespace TestDataGeneratorApp
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Generating test data...");
            var testDataGenerator = new TestDataGenerator();
            testDataGenerator.GenerateTestData();
            Console.WriteLine("Test data generation completed.");
        }
    }
}
This program will generate the test data when you run it. You can find the generated CSV files in the same directory as your executable file.

This is a console application, so you can run it from your terminal or command line interface. When you run the program, it will print a message to let you know that test data generation has begun. After generating the test data, it will print another message to let you know that the process is complete.

Don't forget to include the necessary using statements at the top of the Program.cs file to reference the classes and methods from the Bogus and CsvHelper libraries, as well as the TestDataGenerator class.

To run this Program.cs, you need to have the following classes and their namespaces in the same project or included from the referenced project:

TestDataGenerator
Title
Credit

In the Title and Credit classes I'm getting a warning
CS8618 - Non-nullable variable must contain a non-null value when exiting constructor. Consider declaring it as nullable.
This refers to all the string properties. Rewrite those 2 classes to fix the warnings.
ChatGPT
The warning CS8618 you're seeing is from the C# 8.0 nullable reference types feature. It warns you that you have a non-nullable reference type that isn't initialized to a non-null value in the constructor. We can address this by initializing these fields with default values. Let's fix this in your classes:

csharp
Copy code
public class Title
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string TitleName { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public string Description { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public int ReleaseYear { get; set; }
    public string AgeCertification { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public int Runtime { get; set; }
    public string Genres { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public string ProductionCountry { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public int? Seasons { get; set; }
}

public class Credit
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public int TitleId { get; set; }
    public string RealName { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public string CharacterName { get; set; } = string.Empty;
    public string Role { get; set; } = string.Empty;
}
This approach will initialize all string properties to string.Empty (which is a non-null value) by default. This will make sure they are not null, and you will not get a CS8618 warning.

But remember, if you have nullable reference types enabled (<Nullable>enable</Nullable> in the .csproj file), you should make sure to replace the default values with actual values before you use them, or check for string.IsNullOrEmpty before using these properties, otherwise, you might end up with empty strings where you didn't expect them.
